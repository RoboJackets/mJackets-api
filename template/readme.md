# readme.md

This directory contains a project template to serve as a starting point for mJackets based projects. 

## Project Setup Instructions

1. Run the install script in `utilities` to copy the template directory into your project directory and initialize the submodules.
3. In the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file, change the `CHIP` definition to match your target STM32 chip.
4. Edit/replace the PinDefs.hpp file in the `bsp` directory to match your target board. 
5. Copy your HAL config file from STM32CubeMX into the `bsp` directory.
6. Optionally copy the flash linker script generated by STM32CubeMX into the top-level directory. 
7. Optionally Copy the startup.s file generated by STM32CubeMX into the top-level directory. 
8. In a command prompt, run `cmake configure .` in the top-level directory to configure the build system.

## TODO
- Add a script to check that the previously mentioned files are present before building.
