API Documentation
******************

Well documented APIs enhance the experience for developers and are an essential
requirement for defining an API's success. Doxygen is a general purpose
documentation tool that is used for documenting mJacket's API. It
generates either an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or provides
input for other tools that is used to generate a reference manual from
documented source files. In particular, doxygen's XML output is used as an input
when producing the online documentation.

Reference to Requirements
**************************

APIs for the most part document the implementation of requirements or advertised
features and can be traced back to features. We use the API documentation as the
main interface to trace implementation back to documented features. This is done
using custom _doxygen_ tags that reference requirements maintained somewhere
else in a requirement catalogue.
